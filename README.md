Instagram is becoming a key platform for small businesses. The platform has evolved from a simple social media platform to one where businesses can generate sales straight from the app.

I recently worked with a local small business on a social media strategy where the key performance indicator was follower growth. She sold her products mostly through direct message orders and used her profile to showcase her work. She didn‚Äôt have a website, so Instagram and Facebook were the place where potential customers would go to see her work, find pricing, and reach out to place an order or inquire more.

For many small businesses, this type of strategy is hugely successful. Gone are the days where you need a website in those early stages. To get off the ground, a solid Instagram account can do the job for you; the cost of setting it up is nothing but your time.

A solid social media content strategy can help you grow your follower base, generate new customers, and build your business. By creating a social media plan that encompassed multiple elements, research, and engaging features, I was able to build a solid following on Instagram.

In a 90-day period, I was able to grow her follower base by 75% ‚Äì an average of 25% growth month over month! All with $0 spent and a 100% organic social content strategy.

With a little bit of time, planning, knowledge, and the willingness to try new things, you can definitely accomplish organic social growth for your business.

Here's what I did:

POSTING FREQUENTLY (MINIMUM 3X/WEEK)
Posting a minimum of three times a week is the bare minimum you need to be posting a week in order to see significant results. The more you post, the more likely your posts will end up in people‚Äôs feeds and the more likely you are to get engagement. If you can post daily, even better.

HASHTAGS
 Hashtags help your post gain visibility by showing your content on relevant topic pages and in the ‚Äúdiscover‚Äù section on the app. While it‚Äôs important to include hashtags relevant to your post or industry, such as #smallbusiness #buylocal, it‚Äôs also important to try and take part in national hashtag holidays or themes.

Before I start the content calendar that I mentioned in step one, I Google ‚ÄúMonthly hashtag holidays‚Äù. There‚Äôs usually a great roundup by someone that has all the hashtags for that month listed. I choose ones that are relevant, and then include other more common hashtags like #MotivationalMondays and #TipThursdays.

VARIETY OF CONTENT TYPES
I try to always follow the ‚Äò3 E‚Äô rule for content: Educational, Engaging, Entertaining. Instagram is a platform people use to engage with brands, and you want to post a mix of content to truly build engagement.

Types of content examples:


Educational: How-to‚Äôs, tutorials, tips and facts, product information, industry information, testimonials, team bios
Engaging: Question of the day, funny posts, sneak peaks, quotes, sharable content like graphics, resharing customer posts that include your product
Entertaining: Silly posts, personal posts, behind the scenes, memes

Mix it up, try new things, and see what really resonates with your audience.

ENGAGING STORIES
Every time a new post went live, I teased it through an Instagram story. I would use a ‚Äúnew post‚Äù graphic sticker that said ‚Äúnew post‚Äù, or had a scribble over it, to encourage followers to click through to the post and engage with it.

I also posted a custom story once a week that was more in-depth and had 5-10 pieces to it. I played with things like quizzes, the poll feature, an Ask a Question box, or voting.
